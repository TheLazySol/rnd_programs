This repo/project is mainly used for R&D purposes for VaultiFi's Single-Vault Programs. All WIP content will be posted here before officially being imported to the VaultiFi Organization Repos. 

There will be additions and removals for lines of code very frequently as new things are tested and tried out. This is to prevent creating multiple repositories for every litte test. 

If you are interested in what has been worked on/published and then was removed. There will be various "releases" that you can refer back to. But as of now. Enjoy this live feed as I work on figuring out Single-Vault Programs. This repo is not intended to be listed in the VaultiFi Organization. 

Everything is done on Testnet first then deployed to Devnet. Any keypairs you see are void and are not to be used on mainnet.
